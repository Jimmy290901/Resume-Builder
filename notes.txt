List of Work Exp. - Company, Role, Start Date, End Date, Description

Things learned: -
CSS - 
	gap, row-gap, column-gap		(to allot space between items in a flexbox, grid, etc.)
	@media queries
	max-width: fit-content; (preserves enough width of container as per the content and does not over-enlarge it if 100% width is allowed)
React
	bootstrap react
	useRef Hook - 
		designed to store reference of an HTML element on the web page
		change to that HTML element using useRef hook does not lead to re-render of the component.	(p.o.d from useState)
		NOTE: we can also store values in it just like useState (but with no re-render), but that's not what it was designed for.
		const myRef = useRef();		//it returns an object with only one property - current
		<input type="number" ref={myRef} />		//this stores the reference of input element inside myRef
		Now using myRef.current , we can alter the HTML element without causing any re-render
	useReducer Hook
	map, filter, reduce
	Polyfills
		Piece of code that could run on older browsers as well and provide the necessary functionality which those older browsers would, otherwise, not support.
		Not used exclusively right now due to performance issues and functionality enhancements.
	Webpack

React Router -
1. Advantages = Client Side rendering rather than server side rendering (which is very fast and gives a smooth UX)
2. BrowserRoute, Switch, Route (use "exact" in order to allow matching the path exactly), Links (acts as anchor tags)
